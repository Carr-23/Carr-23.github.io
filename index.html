  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Growing up, I was always around computers thanks to my dad, so as a kid I got close to them. It wasn't until I was in grade 7 when I learned more about programming. That's when I realized the potential that can come from it. I started trying to learn how to code with X-Code, however, I dropped it soon after and it wasn't until grade 10 when I put more time into learning programming.
  <p>
      </p>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now I'm looking to expand my knowledge of the programming world. I want to learn more, and possibly publish more software. My goal for the end of the year is to learn React Native and be able to make my own app with great UI.</div>

Using Object-Oriented Programming I created classes for everything that was gonna be repeated, such as letters. This allowed us to put together a final version of the game fairly quickly. This also allows for external modifications to be made. People have edited the text file to make a new script and make a different story, and thanks to OOP this can be done without any further code required.

Since the one I have isn't some high end "plug and print" one, then I had to learn the ins and outs of it because malfunction is common. Throughout the years I have learned the proper techniques to printing the best part and how to handle the hardware itself. The main thing I loved about having a 3D printer is being able to save money. When buying someone an expensive gift when you could 3D model and 3D print them something that comes from the heart!

Since then I have learned many techniques used with photography. The thing I enjoy most about photography is capturing nature. I love going outside in the wilderness and taking pictures of what I see. Alongside photography, I have learned to carefully edit photos using Lightroom, to bring out the best in every photo.
